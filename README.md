- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzcBsTou0C0&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh (Sentdex Playlist) - In-depth explanation of training a Pytorch model. (Not necessary if you have seen the previous video).

## Topics
### Reinforcement Learning
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJl4iabBEz0&list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV&index=1 Playlist (From Scratch by making a game in Pygame) - You will also learn python better in this playlist (e.g. OOP, Logic, RL...) Recommended
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4 - Another great video
- https://gym.openai.com/ - (https://gym.openai.com/envs/ for environments) Openai Gym link - Games/Envs to train your RF models on
